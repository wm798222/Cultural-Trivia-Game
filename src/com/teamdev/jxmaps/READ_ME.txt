JxMap Demos Instructions:

The following instructions apply to all XXXExample.java example code except for 
the Java FX demos (FXMLExample, JavaFXExample) which are not currently operational.

Google Maps API key:
	The demos can be run without a Google Maps API key but will first show 
	a "This page can't load Google Maps correctly.=" error and then many of 
	the demos may not show the map or show a map with reduced functionality
	that displays a "For development purposes only" watermark.
	
	To use a Google Map API key, paste the key in the Run/Launch configuration 
	for the desired app	as an command line parameter.


The JxMapsDemo app will conveniently run the following demos in a single app:
	MapExample ("Simple Map")
	StyledMapExample
	MarkersExample
	DirectionsExample
	MapOptionsExample
	InfoWindowExample
	GeocoderExample
	StreetViewExample
	ElevationExample
	PlacesSearchExample
	PolygonExample
	PolylineExample
	TrafficLayerExample
	EventsExample

All of the demos included in JxMapsDemo can also be run individually as 
a stand-alone app.

The individual demo apps are all found in the com.teamdev.jxmaps.examples package.
	
The following demos are not included in JxMapsDemo and thus must be 
run individually as a stand-alone app:
	LightweightMapExample
	StreetViewLayoutExample
