 * The visitor to an ILogicalHost that has cases for the 
 * true and false states of the host. 
 * Note that the host is NOT passed to the cases when they are run
 * because the host contains no information other than its state
 * which is known by which case was called.  The host's state is 
 * defined by the case it calls on its visitor. 
 * Any necessary information for the case can be passed in via 
 * the input parameter or whatever the visitor is closing over.
