 * A class that models the mathematical notion of a "predicate",

 * A logical host represents a logical state of being true or false
 * AT THE TIME THAT ITS EXECUTE METHOD IS CALLED.   This state is
 * not required to be the same the next time the execute method is 
 * called.   The current state of the host is defined by the case it 
 * calls on its visitor.
 * @deprecated Switch to provided.util.logic.ILogicalHost immediately!
