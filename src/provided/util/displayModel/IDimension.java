package provided.util.displayModel;

/**
 * Abstract representation of an entity with an integer width and height.
 * This interface is useful for representing components the model needs that 
 * have a width and height, such as a drawing canvas but without exposing the 
 * model to the full GUI-specific objects such as JPanels.   Also, unlike 
 * java.awt.Dimension, this interface is able to represent a dynamically changing
 * width and height, not just a static value.
 * <br><br>
 * Typical usage: Have the controller wrap a GUI element from the view with an 
 * instance of this interface that is then given to the model to use.
